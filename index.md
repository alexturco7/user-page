# About Me

## Introduction
- Hi there! I'm Alex, a second year Computer Science major in Warren.
- I believe that technology will drive positive change and solve real-world problems now and in our future.

## My Journey
- I started my journey into the world of programming in High School.
- I took AP CS A and AP CS P.
- I then decided to continue this journey by majoring in CS in college.

## What I Love
- I'm fascinated by the endless possibilities that software development offers.
- Solving problems and creating solutions proves to be fun.
- I'm also eager to learn more about what makes Software Engineering different from what I've been learning about.

## My Passions
- Apart from coding, I have interests in [running](#), [soccer](#), and [beach days](#).
- I need to get back to running, however, I do intramural soccer.
- Spring quarter I am also planning on getting back to the beach more.

## Favorite Programming Languages
1. **Java**: My first learned language, and frequently used in my start, thanks to good old AP CS and CSE 11/12.
2. **Python**: Love its simplicity and versatility.

## Least Favorite Programming Languages
1. **C**: Ew pointers.

## Code Snippet
